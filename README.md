# WEATHER WEBAPP
Minimal Weather web app created with react 18.2.0 by me

## How to install and use
1. Download the repository, then open an Powershell terminal on your code editor and write 'npm i'
2. To see the project, write 'npm start'
3. To close it, press 'ctrl+c' on the Powershell terminal

## What I Installed
Just react-router-dom to navigate through multiple pages \
NO CSS Framework was used on this. It's design is made on pure CSS

## Overall thoughts and experience
I made this app as a project for the Fullstack-Developer BootCamp i'm doing at the moment, and it was a pretty fun challenge taking in consideration I started studying react 2 weeks ago.\
I built this app with the goal to make it functionally, minimal and aesthethic, since I love doing web design.
If you're looking for an easy and quick way to check the weather on any city in the world for the next 7 days here you go!

## Bugs
1. Accordium cards bugging at some windows widths

## To add
1. Icons for every conditions of the day. There are 60+ conditions and some of them can be use together, so please be patient with it.
2. An interactive map created by hand, with a minimal design like the rest of the web app.
